# DiaCare: Revolutionizing Diabetes Health Management

DiaCare is an innovative platform designed to simplify diabetes management for individuals and families. By integrating with blood glucose monitoring devices, providing real-time tracking, predictive insights, and fostering community collaboration, DiaCare empowers users to take control of their health and stay connected with their loved ones.

## Abstract

Managing diabetes can be especially challenging for families living far apart. DiaCare bridges this gap by offering an intuitive application that tracks blood glucose levels, enables family-sharing features, and supports collective learning through a community platform. This comprehensive solution empowers diabetic individuals and their families with tools for better health management.

## Features

- **Family Sharing**: Stay informed with real-time updates, reminders, and notifications about abnormal blood sugar levels for family members.
- **Seamless Blood Sugar Tracking**: Automatic logging of blood sugar levels through integration with physical glucose meters.
- **Data Visualization and Predictive Insights**: Clear graphs and predictive analysis based on historical data for proactive health management.
- **Community Platform**: An AI-assisted platform for diabetes-related discussions, soon to be upgraded for better collaboration and knowledge sharing.

## Methodology

1. **Understanding the Problem**:
   - Conducted interviews and surveys with diabetic patients and their families to identify pain points.
2. **Data Collection and Analysis**:
   - Leveraged public datasets from sources like Kaggle and Hugging Face for blood sugar trend analysis and predictive modeling.
3. **Design and Development**:
   - Created wireframes using Miro and Figma.
   - Managed tasks with Trello, stored resources on Google Drive, and communicated via Slack.
4. **Prototyping and Testing**:
   - Iteratively built prototypes, incorporated feedback, and tested features to refine the user experience.

## Results

DiaCare delivers a powerful and user-friendly platform with the following results:
- Enhanced diabetes management through real-time tracking and predictive insights.
- Strengthened family connections with shared health updates.
- Fostered community engagement through collective learning and problem-solving.

## Future Vision

Our long-term goal is to evolve DiaCare into a holistic health platform by:
- Expanding beyond blood sugar tracking to include additional health metrics.
